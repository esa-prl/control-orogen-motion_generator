MOTION_GENERATOR COMPONENT
BRANCH: VISODOM

Cmponent to move the rover applying a series of motion_commands at specified times

If it does not compile (it really should) switch to the master branch.
functionality is very basic, the commands are hardcoded in a 2d array defined in the task.hpp file, but it does compile
